                At Corpora, we believe that learning should be as direct and friction-free as possible.
                We build offline-first apps and hand-crafted books that cut out distractions
                and get straight to the heart of every subject.
                No ads. No trackers. Just pure, focused educationâ€”because the best way to master something
                is to eliminate everything that gets in the way.
            </p>

    </section>
